# Digital Kolkhoz

Umbrella-project for villages to co-own assets, vote, and crowdfund using smart contracts. No hidden money, no landlords, everything highly transparent and community-owned.

an Umrella project (a bundle of social alls) to build shared economy and shared ownership of assets for dedicated village's communities living.

## TODO:
- [x] Member A bought 10% of greenhouse A. (smart-contract event recorded)
- [x] when click "Buy 10%" button on UI -> trigger smart-contract event
- [x] update UI percentage owned after each buy
- [ ] change member quantity when purchased
- [ ] create wallet for shared asset (https://speedrunethereum.com/challenge/multisig)


### WHY
- Cities are overpopulated. Remote work can help people come back to village life.
- Kolkhoz has been great until its not :) Transparency can help to patch that.
- Shared ownership of assets will help to build community life.
- Villages are dying. Let's revive 'em.

### HOW
- Remote working villagers
- Sharing goods, services, vehicles, facilities
- Cashless community. Nothing to store under the pillow. Nothing to hide. Nothing to steal.
- Strong NO to investors-owning real estate 
- Strong NO to gentrification

### WHAT

1. Paperless management
2. Karma (reputation) system (insired by Status.network's DevRel Kelly)
3. Crowdfunding
4. Voting for buying shared assets/property
5. Auction
