Qurbani
(refers to the Islamic practice of Qurbani, where a single cow can be shared by up to seven people. This is a common way for individuals to fulfill their sacrificial obligation during the holiday of Eid al-Adha, with each person contributing a portion of the cost and the animal's meat being divided among them)
